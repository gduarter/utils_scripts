### General description

This is a list of scripts used in the Rizzo Lab by Guilherme D. R. Matos

- submit_dock_tests.sh

    Submits dock tests to the queue. For tests involving DOCK6.

- GDRM_dock6_results.py

    Analyzes *_scored.mol2 files produced in DOCK6 tests. Generates a CSV
    file containing all the pertinent data. 

- prep_amber.sh

    Prepares files for AMBER simulations.

- rename_pdb_chains.py

    Renames the chains in pdb files. Homology models generated by SWISS-
    -Model sometimes come with mistaken chain labels. This code fixes it.

- run_gromacs.sh


- prep_docking.sh


- docking_job.sh


- split_ZINC_mol2files.py

    Splits large mol2 files created from ZINC tranches into manageable 
    pieces. 

- split_DOCK_mol2files.py

    Splits large mol2 files created by DOCK from ZINC into manageable
    pieces.

- pick_molecules.py

    Picks molecules of interest from large multimolecule mol2 files based
    on their ZINC IDs.

- calculate_descriptor_statistics.py

    Calculates statistics of all RDKit-related scripts obtained from
    filter or descritor-driven de novo simulations.
